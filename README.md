# Assistant For Linux v2

This helper is here to make your bash commands smaller.

Add this file to your `~/.local/share/` folder if you don't have `~/.local/bin/`. Don't forget to add this to your PATH.

To add `~/.local/share` to your PATH add this

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/share"
```

to end of your `~/.bashrc` file if you don't have `~/.bash_profile`.

Make sure this file is __executable__.

Access available commands with `helper --help` or `helper -h`.
